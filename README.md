webapp-base
A foundational web application template using React (frontend), Flask (backend), PostgreSQL (database), and Nginx (hosting), orchestrated with Docker Compose. Suitable as a starting point for scalable, production-ready web applications.

My WebApp Project
This project consists of a React frontend, Flask backend, PostgreSQL database, and NGINX for reverse proxy. The application is containerized using Docker.

Prerequisites
- Docker
- Docker Compose

Setup
1. Clone the repository
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
```
```bash
   cd yourproject
```

2. Build the Docker containers
```bash
   docker-compose build
```

3. Start the services
```bash
   docker-compose up
```

4. Access the application
   Open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:8086 to see the React frontend.
   Backend API: http://localhost:5001/

Overview
The project architecture is designed to facilitate communication between the React frontend, Flask backend, and PostgreSQL database. NGINX is used as a reverse proxy to handle incoming requests and route them to the appropriate service.

React Frontend
- A simple React application with a form for entering the username.
- On form submission, a JWT-authenticated API call is made to the Flask backend.
- The received username is displayed as "Hello {username}".

Flask Backend
- A Flask API to receive the username from the frontend.
- Utilizes JWT for secure communication.
- Stores and retrieves the username from the PostgreSQL database.
- Sends the username back to the frontend.

PostgreSQL Database
- A PostgreSQL database to store usernames.
- Connected to the Flask backend for data storage and retrieval.

Nginx
- Used as a reverse proxy to route requests to the frontend and backend.
- Provides a single entry point for the application.
- Can manage SSL/TLS for HTTPS if needed.

Interaction Flow
1. User Interaction: The user enters their username in the React frontend form.
2. JWT Authentication: The frontend makes a JWT-authenticated API call to the Flask backend.
3. Data Handling: Flask processes the request, stores the username in PostgreSQL, and sends it back to the frontend.
4. Response Rendering: React receives the username and renders the greeting message.

Customization
You can customize the frontend and backend code to fit your specific application requirements. Additionally, you can modify the Nginx configuration for advanced routing and SSL/TLS setup.
